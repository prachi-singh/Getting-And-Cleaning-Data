#(READ ME) UCI Human Activity Recognition Data Analysis    



This project takes a raw human activity recognition dataset and uses a script run_analysis.R to clean it using Hadley Wickam's [tidy data principles](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html). Desired result, according the Getting And Cleaning Data course assignment specs, is to arrive at a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##run_analysis.R  
The goal of the run_analysis.R script is to prepare from the raw data a tidy dataset that can be used for later analysis. 

Refer to the **Code Book** for design method and steps of tidying the data.

##Raw Dataset Information
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. This dataset is a collection of human activity data using the accelerometer and gyroscope of a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
